SYN's smart contract upgrade goes live on August 10th!

In response to the notification from the NAWA Foundation, the Synthetic Protocol mining pool smart contract will be upgraded and launched on August 10, 2021! The content of this technical upgrade:
 
1. Launch the TRON browser digital asset extraction function; 

2. Complete the ERC and TRC dual-chain protocol exchange function. The estimated upgrade time is 24 hours, but it will not affect any income of the mining pool.

Major technological breakthrough: The launch of the SYN double-chain protocol is a technological innovation in the field of DAPP! Even if the global DAPP stops running, it will not cause any loss of assets on the SYN platform! This is the only technical guarantee!
